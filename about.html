    <p>Mr. M S Karthik set up a school in Kotipura in 2012 to cater the basic education needs of the people of his village. Mr Karthik Sahukar started <b> Everon high school </b>
         in 2017 to bring about innovative changes in the feild of education.He initiated the coaching for the state level exams along with NCERT syllabus.
        Mr.Karthik Sahukar felt that just 6 hours class room teaching alone will not enable the overall development of the students.So to make the students remain in the campus for all 24 hours
    of the day, he brought the boarding facilities to the forefront.Effective coaching to the 10th students were also introduced.
Everon also has the credit of introducing the different educational possibilities like crash course, vacation course,summer camp, etc. </p><br>
